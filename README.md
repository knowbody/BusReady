BusReady
===

Playing around with React Native for the first time and solving my first world problem.

### Problem
I go to the bus stop, and just missing my bus OR have to wait 5+ mins for the next one.

### Solution
Build the app which will check my matching buses, check their arrival time. 
The app considers my walk time to the bus stop and my wait time (both hard coded for now).
If it's good to leave home the binary response is shown - green (YES), red (NO), plus the next bus info.
